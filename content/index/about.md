I am a theoretical chemist turned research software engineer.

I write research software and teach programming to researchers. I am involved
in the
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project
and in the community of
[Nordic research software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org/).

I work as senior scientist at [Oceanbox](https://oceanbox.io).
I have a 20% position at the [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no)
as part of the [Norwegian e-infrastructure for research and education](https://sigma2.no)
and the [High Performance Computing Group](https://hpc.uit.no).
My focus at UiT is to help build
the [Research Software Engineering Group](https://research-software.uit.no).

Earlier, I have worked at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in
Toulouse, and [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se) and the Theoretical Chemistry and
Biology group in Stockholm.
