I am a theoretical chemist turned research software engineer.

I work as senior scientist at [Oceanbox](https://oceanbox.io) where I write
Rust and Fortran and develop tools and models using computational geometry and
computational fluid dynamics.  I am involved in the
[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org) project and in the community of
[Nordic research software engineers](https://nordic-rse.org/).

Earlier, I have worked
at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no)
as part of the [Norwegian e-infrastructure for research and education](https://sigma2.no)
and the [High Performance Computing Group](https://hpc.uit.no).
At UiT,
I have started the  [Research Software Engineering Group](https://research-software.uit.no).
Before that, I have worked
at the Laboratoire de Chimie et Physique Quantiques in
Toulouse, and [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se) and the Theoretical Chemistry and
Biology group in Stockholm.
