      Numerically tolerant end-to-end test library for scientific codes.
      The aim of this library is to make the testing and maintenance of tests easy.
      The library allows to extract portions of the program output(s) which are
      automatically compared to reference outputs with a relative or absolute
      numerical tolerance to compensate for numerical noise due to machine precision.

      XCint integrates the exchange-correlation (XC) energy ExcExc and the elements
      of the XC potential matrix VxcVxc, as well as their derivatives with respect to
      electric field and/or geometric perturbations. The integration is performed on
      a standard numerical grid.

      XCFun is a library of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals to be used in
      density-functional theory (DFT) codes. XCFun follows a unique implementation
      strategy which enables the computation of derivatives of the XC functional
      kernel up to arbitrary order. It does so by relying on forward-mode automatic
      differentiation.
      Code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dftlibs/xcfun).
      Documentation is on [Read the Docs](https://xcfun.readthedocs.io/).

      This library computes arbitrary-order exchange-correlation function(al)
      derivatives using
      [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/).
      The emphasis of this project is on ease of use and ease of adding functionals
      in Python. The focus is not (yet) on performance. Our hope is that this project
      can make it easier to test new implementations of functional derivatives but
      maybe also used directly to provide functional derivatives in a density
      functional theory program.
